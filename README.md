# IPL Data Analysis using Apache Spark and Databricks

## Overview

This project performs data analysis on IPL (Indian Premier League) matches and players using Apache Spark on Databricks. The data used in this project was sourced from [data.world](https://data.world/raghu543/ipl-data-till-2017) and covers IPL matches until 2017.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Provides insights into IPL matches, teams, and player statistics using PySpark.
- **Data Processing**: Leverages the power of Spark for efficient data cleaning, transformation, and processing of large IPL datasets.
- **Visualization**: Uses various libraries to visualize IPL data trends over the years.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains data on IPL matches, including:

- Match details (teams, dates, venues, results)
- Player statistics
- Team performances

The data is available at: [IPL Data Till 2017](https://data.world/raghu543/ipl-data-till-2017).

## Technologies Used

- **Apache Spark**: Distributed data processing.
- **Databricks**: Cloud platform for big data analysis and machine learning.
- **Python (PySpark)**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Used to run Spark code interactively.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/kajalmahajan23/IPL-Data-Analysis-using-Apache-Spark-and-Databricks](https://github.com/kajalmahajan23/IPL-Data-Analysis-using-Apache-Spark-and-Databricks.git)
   cd IPL-Data-Analysis-using-Apache-Spark-and-Databricks
   ```

2. Upload the notebook (\`IPL_Data_Analysis_Spark_using_Databricks.ipynb\`) to your Databricks environment.

3. Ensure you have access to the dataset. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://data.world/raghu543/ipl-data-till-2017).

4. Run the notebook cells in your Databricks environment to execute the analysis.
